# Soundcloud Audio Reactive Example

This example **does NOT WORK**.

Soundcloud changed their API but has provided no working
examples of how to use it. Hopefully they can update this
example to work.

## Usage:

```
git clone https://github.com/greggman/soundcloud-audio-reactive-example.git
cd soundcloud-audio-reactive-example
npm init
CLIENT_ID="your-client-id" SECRET="your-secret" node index.js
```

Now open the browser to `http://localhost:8080` and open the
browser's dev tools.
